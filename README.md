# JOB-PORTAL-APPLICATION
The online job portal system is a platform between job seekers and job providers (company). The Job 
seeker can easily find and apply for a job by login into the system. The Employer or company can easily 
get an expert employee from our job portal site by posting a job.
Create a web application for a company that will be used by job seekers to apply to the job 
requirements. 
We will create a front end where users will view jobs.
There will be a login page which also has register functionality. 
The user will be taken to the home page after login, where they can view different jobs.
